# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my version of the rock-paper-scissors game.

    During this project I learned:

        - How to problem solve: - Unederstand the problem.
                                - Plan.
                                - Divide and conquer.
        - Add event listeners and query selectors.
        - Understand erros.
        - Write cleaner code.
        - Use conditionals and functions to write game logic.

I would be happy to recive feedback from anyone who views the code.

Thanks in advance!
